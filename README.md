# VirtualTreeView-Lazarus
This is the Lazarus port of Virtual Treeview control. Please note that this is an experimental fork of VTV for lazarus and is not yet ready for production use.

This port is based on work done by Luiz Américo Pereira Câmara (https://github.com/blikblum/VirtualTreeView-Lazarus). It is an attempt to try to keep this port aligned with the official repo. If you need something stable, keep using the https://github.com/blikblum/VirtualTreeView-Lazarus version.

## Requirements
 * Lazarus 2.2 or newer
 * fpc 3.2.0 or newer
 * LCL Extensions 0.6 or newer
